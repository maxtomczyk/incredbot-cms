## Versions =< 1.1.2
Versions 1.1.2 and lower are probably impossible to install via init and in some cases as dependancy due to Apexcharts module which caused problem with dependencies after it's update. Please start all your projects from 1.1.3 or higher and consider updating your existing projects based on versions 1.1.2 and lower. If you can't update project to Powerbot CMS 1.1.3 lock apexchart dependency on version 2.6.0 and vue-apexchart on 1.2.8.
